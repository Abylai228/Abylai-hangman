That is a brief report about my project hangman.
I used string and string builder and some commands such append, random etc
In my code you can choose any word by putting it into string [] and play
The concept is simple as in an original game, player has a word to guess and 6 attempts to do that.
if player guessed the word it says correct if not he has 1 attempt less
I did it with the help of the if and boolean 
In conclusion i can say that it was amusing project to do i also checked some guides on youtube but ended up by doing by myself
